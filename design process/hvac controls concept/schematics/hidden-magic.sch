Temperature sensor
Originally Ish was really irritated that we did not get thermocouples. He changed his mind. I guess it does not matter so long as the thing is of reasonable quality.

THERMOSTAT1
Currently this is a TCY-M4-U. While the vendor (VECTOR) is very good at supporting this product it has had reliablity issues. These were purchased through T.A.C. 
which was also over complicated and expensive as they had to be semi custom. That application in the other chambers is more complex and I think we can find 
something simpler.

VALVE1 - Plan #1 - Air to Water
VP526A1068 we are actually happy with this part. They fail only very occationally and when they do the hospital has them on hand for fast replacement.

VALVE2 - Electricity to Air
Current source in chamber 1-4 is Mamac Model # EP-313 we are reasonably happy with this part.

DCSUPPLY1 - 24V DC Supply
Currently this is a CPB-24D-30 which is a totaly piece of junk. We had 2 self imolate.

T1 - 120V to >24V Transformer
This part is currently an X040AAA which is a 40VA 24V stepdown transformer intended to run a small security system. While it has performed very well and is 
over rated in VA it is under rated in voltage. Just have them buy a full power supply.

Approved Power Supply Vendors (alternatives to DCSUPPLY1 + Transformer)
Power-One, Condor, Omron, TDK Lambda, Tripp Lite or Meanwell.
Please buy only only closed frame.
