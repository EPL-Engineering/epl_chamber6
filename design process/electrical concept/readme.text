The content of this directory was drafted by Ishmael and myself while we were working out how the chamber should be wired. I know normally the new versions would simply replace the old ones in the repo. However, I do not like working that way when the objective is to show how the final concept evolved over time. It is also true that some of these plans are equally functional electrically. We selected the final one for other reasons of safety, cost and archetectural contraint.
